# C, Wayland, Vulkan and GLES Demos
This is my personal dump for programs written in C, Vulkan and/or OpenGL ES with Wayland compatibility (will not use GLX, may or may not add Windows support to some of these later on)

These demos will range from simple spinning triangles to basic GUI applications and games.

TODO:
* Spinning Triangle (C, GLES, Wayland)
* Spinning Gears (C, GLES, Wayland)
* VSpinning Triangle (C, Vulkan, Wayland)
* VSpinning Gears (C, Vulkan, Wayland)
* Calculator (C, GLES, Wayland)
* VCalculator (C, Vulkan, Wayland)
* 2D Chess (C, GLES, Wayland)
* 2D VChess (C, Vulkan, Wayland)
* 3D Chess (C, GLES, Wayland)
* 3D VChess (C, Vulkan, Wayland)

More as time passes on... (Dynamically switchable vulkan/GL backends, and live preview rendering models)
